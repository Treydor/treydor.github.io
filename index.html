    <p>Hello, my name is Noah Rogers</p>

    <p>Learning about HTML &amp; CSS is something I enjoy doing.</p>

    <p>When I am not experimenting here I am usually trying to plan my next trip abroad, playing video games or spending time with my beautiful wife, Hannah. </p>

    <p>If you'd like, feel free to check my <a href="https://github.com/treydor" target="_blank">GitHub</a> or say hi on <a href="https://twitter.com/treyd0r" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.</p>
