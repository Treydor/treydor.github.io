    <div class="profile-title">Hi, my name is <strong>Noah Rogers</strong>.</div>

    I recently graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Sociology. Although I really enjoy the topic, one of my true interests is learning how to make websites.</p>

    <p>When I am not experimenting here I am usually thinking about traveling, playing video games or spending time with my best friend and wife, Hannah. </p>
