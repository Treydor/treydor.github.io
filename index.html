    <p class="center">Hi, my name is Noah.</p>

    <p>I recently graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Sociology. Although I really enjoy my area of study, my true interests is learning how to make websites.</p>

    <p>When I am not experimenting here I am usually thinking about traveling, playing video games or spending time with my wife, Hannah. </p>
