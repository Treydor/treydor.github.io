    <div class="profile-title">Hello, my name is Noah</div>

    <p>I recently graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Sociology. Although I really enjoy my area of study. one of my hobbies is learning how to create websites.</p>

    <p>When I am not experimenting here I am usually thinking about traveling, playing video games or spending time with my wife, Hannah. </p>
