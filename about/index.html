    <p>I love traveling, playing video games, enjoying mexican food and spending time with my wife Hannah. Learning about HTML and CSS is something I really enjoy doing.</p>

    <p>I created this page as a place for friends to follow along with me while I begin to learn and experiment with bits of HTML and CSS.</p>
