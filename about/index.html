    <p>I recently graduated with a degree in Sociology with an emphasis in Criminal Justice. Although I really enjoy the subject, my true interest is learning about HTML, CSS and Design.</p>

    <p>When I am not working here I enjoy traveling, playing video games, eating Mexican food and spending time with my beautiful wife Hannah. </p>
