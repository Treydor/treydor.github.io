    <p class="profile-title">Hi, i'm Noah</p>
    <p>I recently graduated with college with a degree in Sociology. Although I really enjoy the subject, one of my true interests is, and always has been, learning about HTML and CSS.</p>

    <p>When I am not working here I enjoy traveling, playing video games, trying new types of food and spending time with my  wife Hannah. </p>
