          <p>Positioning gives us a lot of control over our elements. The position property has multiple dependencies and is mostly influenced by the properties of parent elements.</p>
          <p>In this project we will take a look at the basic types of positioning and how they interact with each other. We'll also learn about offset properties and z-index.</p>
          <p>Let's get started!</p>

          <ul class="section-list">
            <li>
              <h2>Static</h2>
              <p>This property is the default positioning property for all elements. A static property keeps your element within the normal flow of your HTML document and does not work with any offset properties like top, right, bottom and left.</p>
              <p>One of the most common uses for static is that it gives us the ability to forcefully remove a positioning property from an element that was inherited elsewhere.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h2>Relative</h2>
              <p>Relative positioning is one of the most used and most confusing of the positioning properties. A relative positioning property works very similar to static in the sense that it will not take your element out of the normal flow of your HTML document. The big difference between static and relative is that with relative you are able to use top, right, bottom and left properties.</p>
              <p>It is important to remember that changing an element's position to relative and not assigning move properties will result in no visual change to the element.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h2>Absolute</h2>
              <p>Elements with an absolute positioning property are taken out of the normal flow of your HTML document and are, by default, attached to the closest relative or absolute positioned parent element. With absolute positioning you can move your element wherever you want on your page using top, right, bottom and left properties.</p>
              <p>The only catch to absolute is if not attached to another element, it is at the mercy of the user's viewport because it has been taken out of the normal flow of the HTML document.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h2>Fixed</h2>
              <p>An element with a fixed position is essentially anchored to a certain spot within the user's viewport. A fixed position is neat because the element will remain in its location even when the user scrolls up, down or resizes the window. This type of positioning property is not common, but certainly has some uses.</p>
              <p>Now that we know the basic properties, let's take a look at a few live examples of how parent and child elements interact with one another.</p>

          <h3 class="summary">Properties that allow you to move positioned elements</h3>
          <p>Using offset properties can be extremely helpful. In the example above, a property of <code>right: 60px;</code> was added to our parent element. This in turn gave us more room to move our child element. Adding <code>left: 125px;</code> to our child element lets us move our child element 125 pixels to the left of our parent element.</p>
          <p>The nice thing about these properties is that the child element will always remain 194 pixels to the left of our parent element regardless of where it is moved since it is positioned as absolute.</p>

          <h2>z-index</h2>
          <p>The z-index property controls the stacking order of positioned elements, allowing them to overlap one another.</p>          
          <p>Confused about z-index? I was too. Here is an example that demonstrates exactly how it works.</p>
            <div class="table top-margin">
              <div class="row cf">
                <div class="column half add-border">
                  <div class="luigi z-index-2"></div>
                  <div class="star2 z-index-1"></div>
                </div>
                <div class="column half">
                  <div class="remove-padding-right">
                    <p>In this situation the star is behind Luigi in the stack order since it's z-index is less than Luigis'.</p>
                    <p>Think of z-index as layers, the higher the number associated with z-index, the greater priority for it to be the top-most layer.</p>
                  </div>
                </div>
              </div>
              <div class="row cf">
                <div class="column half add-border">
                  <div class="luigi z-index-1"></div>
                  <div class="star2 z-index-2"></div>
                </div>
                <div class="column half">
                  <div class="remove-padding-right">
                  <p>Swapping the z-index of the elements reverses the stack order, putting our star on top.</p>
                  <p>The current range for z-index is about 2,147,483,638 on the most common browsers, so go crazy with all your z-indexing! :)</p>
                  </div>
                </div>
              </div>
            </div>
            <h3 class="summary">There are times when you cannot use z-index</h3>
            <p>There are boundaries with z-index. Remember, z-index only works on absolute, relative and fixed positioned elements. Also, make sure you take in nesting in to account when using z-index. If one element is nested within another, it can never have a higher z-index than it's parent.</p>
