          <p>When thinking about positioning in terms of HTML and CSS, most of us agree that there are multiple ways to accomplish the same goal. What we don't always know is which is the most efficient.</p>
          <p>In our last blog we talked about the advantages as well as the disadvantages of floats. Floats are an extremely useful tool that really give us a lot of freedom to organize and put things where we want.</p>
          <p>Let's add to what we already know about positioning from floats and talk about a few very common positioning types. We will also talk about how these properties work with one another and at the end we will take a look at another very essential property that coincides with positioning.</p>
          <p>Let's take a look at some of the most common positioning properties that we currently have available to us.</p>

    <section>
      <div class="container">      
        <ul class="section-list cf">
          <li>
            <h3>1. Static</h3>
            <p>This property is the default positioning property for all elements. A static property keeps your element within the normal flow of your HTML document and does not work with any offset properties like top, right, left and bottom.</p>
            <p>One of the most common uses for static is that it gives us the ability to forcefully remove a positioning property from an element that was inherited elsewhere.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>2. Relative</h3>
            <p>Relative positioning is one of the most used and most confusing of the positioning properties. A relative property works very similar to static in the sense that it will not take your element out of the normal flow of your HTML document. The big difference between static and relative is that with relative you are able to use offset properties.</p>
            <p>It is important to remember that changing an element's position to relative and not assigning offset properties will result in no change to the element.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>3. Absolute</h3>
            <p>Elements with an absolute positioning property are taken out of the normal flow of your HTML document and are, by default, <q>attached</q> to the closest relative or absolute positioned parent element. With absolute positioning you can move your element wherever you want on your page using offset properties. <p>The only catch to absolute is if not <q>attached</q> to another element, it is at the mercy of the user's viewport because it has been taken out of the normal flow of the HTML document.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>4. Fixed</h3>
            <p>An element with a fixed position is essentially <q>anchored</q> to a certain spot within the user's viewport. A fixed position is neat because the element will remain in its location even when the user scrolls up, down or resizes the window. This type of positioning property is not common, but certainly has some uses. A Navigation you want to follow you down the page is a great example.</p>
            <p>Now that we know the basic properties, let's take a look at a few live eamples of how parent and child elements interact with one another.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <div class="container">
        <div class="row cf">
          <div class="column remove-border">
            <div class="mario"></div>
            <h2 class="column-heading">Parent</h2>
            <p class="column-summary">Mario will represent the parent element. A parent element contains children elements.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="column remove-border">
            <div class="bowser"></div>
            <h2 class="column-heading">Child</h2>
            <p class="column-summary">Bowser will represent the child element. The child element is contained by its parent element.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row cf">
          <div class="remove-border column">
            <div class="example-heading">Parent: Static</div>
            <div class="example-heading">Child: Static</div>            
            <p>Uh oh, it looks like Mario is stuck behind Bowser. This is because when a child element is put inside of a parent element, the child element is essentially layered on top. In this example, both the parent and child elements are set to static. A static positioning property is the default of every element we use.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="column">
            <div class="mario2">
              <div class="bowser"></div>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row cf">
          <div class="column remove-border">
            <div class="example-heading">Parent: Static</div>
            <div class="example-heading">Child: Relative</div>
            <p>Here Mario is now visible, but things still look off. Our parent element, Mario, is positioned as static and Bowser is now positioned relative. In addition to changing the positioning, we have also added offeset properties of left 100px and bottom 50px. <strong>Offset properties</strong> give us control of exactly where we want to position elements these elements.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="column">
            <div class="mario2 static">
              <div class="bowser-relative"></div>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row cf">
          <div class="column remove-border ">
            <div class="example-heading">Parent: Relative</div>
            <div class="example-heading">Child: Absolute</div>
            <p>Here we have changed our parent element to relative and added offset properties bottom -25px and left -50px. We then set our child element, Bowser, to absolute with an offset property of left 130px. This ensures that the child element will be 130px away of wherever our Mario is moved.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="column">
            <div class="mario2-relative">
              <div class="bowser-absolute"></div>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

    </section>

    <section class="special">
      <div class="container">
        <div class="special-title">What about the Star?</div>
        <p>The star that has been following us on the left side of the screen is set to a fixed position. This property allows whatever element we specify to be set to a fixed area within the browser's viewing area, or viewport.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <div class="container">
        <div class="box cf">
          <h2 class="box-title">z-index</h2>
          <p>The z-index property controls the stacking order of positioned elements, allowing them to overlap one another. An easy way to think of it is like using layers. How z-index works is very simple, basically, the higher the number associated with z-index means the greater priority for it to be the top-most <q>layer</q>.</p>
          <p>Here is an example that demonstrates exactly how z-index works.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="row cf">
          <div class="column">
            <div class="luigi z-index-2"></div>
            <div class="star2 z-index-1"></div>
          </div>
          <div class="column remove-border">
            <p>In this situation the star will always be behind Luigi in the stack order since it's z-index is 1 and Luigi's z-index is 2.</p>
            <p>On a fun, side note, the z-index number range is huge, we're talking billions. The current max range supported by most browsers is 2,147,483,638.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row cf">
          <div class="column">
            <div class="luigi z-index-1"></div>
            <div class="star2 z-index-2"></div>
          </div>
          <div class="column remove-border">
            <p>Changing the z-index of Luigi to 1, and the star to 2 reverses the stack order.</p>
            <p>This allows the star to come forward where it now rests comfortably in Luigi's hand.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="box">
          <p>When using z-index it is important to remember is that there are boundaries. The first thing to remember is that <strong>z-index only works on positioned elements</strong>.</p>
          <p>The second thing you want to take into account is how your elements are nested within each other. When nested, your <strong>child element can never have a greater z-index than its parent</strong>.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
