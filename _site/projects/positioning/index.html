          <h2 class="box-title">introduction</h2>
          <p>When thinking about positioning in terms of HTML and CSS, most of us agree that there are multiple ways to accomplish the same goal. What we don't always know is which is the most efficient.</p>
          <p>In our last blog we talked about the advantages as well as the disadvantages of floats. Floats are an extremely useful tool that really give us a lot of freedom to organize and put things where we want.</p>
          <p>Let's add to what we already know about positioning from floats and talk about a few very common positioning types. We will also talk about how these properties work with one another and at the end we will take a look at another very essential property that coincides with positioning.</p>

          <li>
            <h3>Static</h3>
            <p>The default positioning property for all elements. Static keeps your element within the normal flow of your HTML document and does not work with any offset properties like top, right, left and bottom.</p>
            <p>Static positioning should be used when trying to forcefully remove a positioning property for an element.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Relative</h3>
            <p>Relative positioning is one of the most used and most confusing positioning properties. A relative property works very similar to static in the sense that it will not take your element out of the normal flow of your HTML document. The big difference between static and relative is that you are able to use offset properties.</p>
            <p>It is important to remember that changing an elements position to relative and not assigning offset properties will result in no change to the element.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Absolute</h3>
            <p>Elements with an absolute position property are taken out of the normal flow of your HTML document. Elements that are positioned using absolute are, by default, <q>attached</q> to the closest relative or absolute positioned parent element.
            <p>With absolute positioning you can literally move your element wherever you want on your page using offset properties.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Fixed</h3>
            <p>An element with a fixed position is positioned in relation to the user's viewport. A fixed position element will hold the specified location even if the user scrolls the page or resizes the window. This type of positioning property is not common, but certainly has some uses. Navigations are a great example.</p>
            <p>Do you see any elements with a fixed position?</p>

          <div class="column remove-border">
            <div class="mario"></div>
            <h2 class="column-heading">Parent</h2>

          </div>

        <div class="row cf">

          <div class="remove-border column">
            <h3 class="example-heading">Mario needs help!</h3>
            <p>Mario seems to be stuck behind Bowser. This is because when a child element is put inside of a parent element, the child element is essentially layered on top. In this example, both the parent and child elements are set to static. A static positioning property is the default of every element we use. Let's see if we can use some other elements to uncover Mario.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="column">
            <div class="mario2">
              <div class="bowser"></div>
            </div>
          </div>

        </div>

        <div class="row cf">

          <div class="column remove-border">
            <h3 class="example-heading">Parent: Static<br>Child: Relative</h3>
            <p>Here our friend Mario is now visible. In this example we left our parent element, Mario, positioned as static. We have set our child element to a relative position. In addition to changing the position, we have also added a left and bottom property to place Bowser exactly where desire. Let's try and line these two up so they can get a good look at each other.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="column">
            <div class="mario2 static">
              <div class="bowser-relative"></div>
            </div>
          </div>

        </div>

        <div class="row cf">
          <div class="column remove-border ">
            <h3 class="example-heading">Parent: Relative<br>Child: Absolute</h3>
            <p>Here everything looks pretty good except the fact that we are now outside of our border. In this example we have changed our parent element to relative, and positioned it accordingly using bottom and left properties. We then set our child element, Bowser, to absolute. This ensures that the child element will remain <q>attached</q> to its parent regardless of where the parent is moved.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="column">
            <div class="mario2-relative">

        <h1 class="special-title">What about the star?</h1>
        <p>The star that has been following us is set to a fixed position. This property allows whatever element we specify to be set to a fixed position within the browser's viewing area, or viewport.</p>

        <p>The star in the upper right has been fixed to the top-right corner with a 25px margin.</p>

        <p>With the star in our reach, I will introduce the last and final property that is essential when talking about positioning properties.</p>

        <div class="box cf">
          <h2 class="box-title">z-index</h2>
          <p>The z-index property controls the stacking order of positioned elements, allowing them overlap one another. Think of it as using layers. How z-index works is very simple, basically, the higher the z-index, the greater priority for it to be the top-most <q>layer</q>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="row cf">
          <div class="column">
            <div class="luigi z-index-2"></div>
            <div class="star2 z-index-1"></div>
          </div>
          <div class="column remove-border">
            <h3 class="example-heading">Luigi's Z-Index = 2<br>Star's Z-Index = 1</h3>
            <p>In this situation the star will always be behind Luigi in the stack order since the number associated with it is less than Luigi's.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="row cf">
          <div class="column">
            <div class="luigi z-index-1"></div>
            <div class="star2 z-index-2"></div>
          </div>
          <div class="column remove-border">
            <h3 class="example-heading">Luigi's Z-Index = 1<br>Star's Z-Index = 2</h3>
            <p>Changing the z-index of both Luigi and the Star we adjust the stack order. This allows to put the star comfortably in Luigi's hand.</p>
            <p>Great job! We got the star!</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="box bg-none remove-padding-top">
          <p>When using z-index it is important to remember that there are limits. One of the biggest things to remember is that z-index only works on positioned elements. The second thing you want to take into account is nesting. When nested your child element can never have a greater z-index than its parent.</p>
