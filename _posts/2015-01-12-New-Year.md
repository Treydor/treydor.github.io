This may be the latest happiest "Happy New Year" greeting you'll see in 2015, so I'll just say it, Happy New Year! I know that I have been away from this for quite some time, but I have made the decision now to start up again and continue learning about everything HTML and CSS.

My goal really has not changed. I do this because I like it, and I think it's fun. Often times, I'll stop playing video games, or stop watching television because I would much rather tweak something on the site, or try to learn something new.

In the last few days I have taken it upon myself to somewhat hit the reset button. I thought about completely starting over and creating a new, simplified layout in hopes that it would assist me with refreshing everything I have learned in the last six months. Instead, I have opted to search through everything I have done thus far and re-learn every item that I am not 100% familiar with.

Along the way I have refreshed the page with a slightly simplified layout tweaks. In my <a href="/projects/">projects</a> section I have updated it to show a few things of which I am currently working on.  I do not have a timetable of when they will be live, but I have been devoting time to all of them.

Anyway, I hope 2014 was a great year for all of you. Here is to a great 2015.

Happy New Year!
