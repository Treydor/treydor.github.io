This post is a continuation of my previous blog post, [{{ page.previous.title }}]({{ page.previous.url }}), where I talked about the benefits of interviewing potential users.

Once the majority of the interviews were completed we brought our findings to Eric and talked about some of things the users said. In our meeting we were able to decide on what v1 of the app should look like.

### MVP
Minimum viable product, or MVP, are the features we wanted to include in the app at launch. There was a lot we learned from our interviews and even more we talked about with Eric. It was important to keep our MVP fairly basic, but build the app in such a way that we can easily add features in future versions. In addition to creating a list of apprentices and displaying important dates about their apprenticeships we also wanted to tackle how review boards were rolled and displayed.

As it stood, the process was completely static. Choosing a review board required a specific individual to manually update a database. Manually updating the database was a pretty involved task. The individual would have to add new Craftsmen who recently passed their apprenticeship challenges and update the exclusion list if somebody happened to be out of the office that week. The process wasn't hard, but definitely took time out of that person's day. A review board feature would also allow any Craftsmen to currently see who is on an apprentice's review board.

### To the drawing board
Having nailed down our MVP, Chris and I wrote down the features that we expected to launch with version one and also some features that would come in later versions.

### To be continued...
The next step is to actually begin creating wireframes and higher resolution mockups. Make sure to keep a look out for another post on the continuation of this process.
