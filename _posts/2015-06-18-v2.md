Today I have released an updated version of my personal site. Although there isn't a whole lot "in your face" visual changes, there are numerous changes to the how the pages are structured. Over the next few weeks, I continue to build off the changes.

Some of the changes to the new site include:

* Complete redesign using Sass
* Updates project page
* Updates older projects so that they now stand alone
* Updates visual styles of numerous elements
* Adds Font Awesome icons
* Adds work section and content
* Adds new projects
* Adds new blog posts
* Cleans up old, excess and crummy code
