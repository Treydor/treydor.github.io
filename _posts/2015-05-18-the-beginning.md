In the beginning, or let's say, when I was young, I began experimenting with HTML. I built websites about video games that I loved to play. I created these websites on hosting services like Angelfire, Geocities and Homestead. At the time, I knew nothing about CSS, but that didn't stop me from creating entire websites out of nothing but pictures and links.

If I only I could see those websites again...

Fast-forward roughly 20 years and here I am. Over the last year I renewed my interest in HTML and CSS. Knowing nothing more than how to create a link at the time, I am proud of where I am today. Now, web design is not only one of my biggest hobbies, but I find myself hopeful that this will, one day, lead to a career.

When I was a child my parents bought me a sketch pad. One of the reasons I enjoyed sketching was because you could literally draw whatever you wanted. If you could think it, you could draw it. I think this same principle is what attracts to me to web design. I love creating things.

Why do you love building things for the web? [Let me know](https://twitter.com/noaharogers).
