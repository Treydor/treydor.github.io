In the beginning, or let's say, when I was young, I began experimenting with HTML. I built websites about video games that I loved to play. I created these websites on hosting services like Angelfire, Geocities and Homestead. At the time, I knew nothing about CSS, but that did not stop me from creating entire websites out of nothing but pictures and links.

If only I could see those websites again...

Fast-forward roughly 20 years and here I am. Over the last year I have renewed my interest in HTML and CSS. Although I still have a lot to learn, I am very proud of where I am today.
