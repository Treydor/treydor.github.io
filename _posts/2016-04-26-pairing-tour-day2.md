On day two of my pairing tour I was able to spend some time with my mentor [Chris Peak](http://www.chrispeak.me). Today Chris and I tackled a few different things.

Our day started with with a meeting between the designers and the London office. Without diving too deep, the London office is looking to expand their UX/Design program, and wanted input from us and our process when it comes to hiring designers. It was a great experience hearing what my mentor's actually look for in candidates.

After our meeting Chris showed me a project he has been working on the last few months. Even though I can't go in to much detail about the project, I can say that the improvements are much needed, and will be a big upgrade to what is currently out there!

The afternoon was full with different tasks. We enjoyed a  community lunch where everyone got to let loose, laugh and bond for a while. That's one thing I really like about being at 8th Light. Not only do they prioritize learning, which I also really like, but the Crafters here insist on developing relationships and getting to know their fellow team members.

Later in the afternoon I was fortunate enough to meet a new design applicant. Erica had her come in so she could see the office. The four of us ended up talking a little bit where we chatted about the 8th Light apprenticeship and the overall direction of the design team.

The remainder of the day was devoted to a potential new project. Kyle, 8th Light's writer, provided us with a basic overview of the project. With all the information, Chris and I began to brainstorm a name, while also starting to spike out what the project's logo may look like.
