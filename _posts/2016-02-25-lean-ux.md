Recently, I participated in a few user interviews for a new app we were developing.

To be frank, UX is challenging.

### Create your hypothesis

Assumption you are making.

Important assumptions wrong lead to failure.

Rather than think of a great new idea, aim to build a product that solves a problem.

Sometimes the best problems to solve are the problems that users are not even aware of.

Just because a problem exists, don't mean enough people will value your idea (or app).

### Get validation

Identify your market.

Listen to your users.

#### Qualitative vs. Quantitative research

Qualitative - Interview and observation.

Quantitative - Stats, reading and understanding data and metrics.

Qualitative is not right for every situation. Lots of time and money needed.

Ask them to walk through their process. Why do they do things a certain way? Is everyone preforming similar tasks that could be made easier?

The biggest mistake is to tell your users what you are working on, and how great it will be for him/her.

Describing your product and asking if that will solve a user's problem is not the way to go. Showing a user something and observing them is a much better option.

Learn about your user's problems. Why do they do them that way?

Ask open-ended questions.

### Always iterating
