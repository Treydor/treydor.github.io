Today I have released an updated version of my personal site. I decided to go with a similar layout, but introduced changes to some of the visual styles and overall color scheme.

Some of the changes to the new site include:

* Complete redesign using Sass.
* Updated [blog](/blog/), [project](/projects/) and [work](/work/) pages.
* Updates older projects so that they now stand alone.
* Removes images and adds Font Awesome icons.
* Cleans up old, excess and crummy code.

So far I really like the changes. In the future I plan on adding a separate page for each work item instead of linking straight to the website. I also plan to add a contact page that way anyone can send me an email through a form.

That's it for today, have a great day!
