While working on the [distribution page](http://citypak.org/distributions) for [The Citypak Project](http://citypak.org), I began to learn about and use a very powerful layout tool called flexbox.

Flexbox is great because it allows us to easily solve problems we face when trying to align items within a container.

#### Flexbox usage
Start by adding the following code to your parent, or flex container.

    .flex-container {
      display: -webkit-flex; /* Safari */
      display: flex;
    }

That's it! We're now ready to apply properties to child elements, known as flex items.


    .flex-item {
      -webkit-align-items: center; /* Safari */
      align-items:         center;
    }


Something like this would allow us to vertically align items within a container. There a wide variety of properties that can be applied to flex items. [A Visual Guide to CSS3 Flexbox Properties](https://scotch.io/tutorials/a-visual-guide-to-css3-flexbox-properties) talks about most of them and even has a lot of live examples to show you exactly how the flex properties work.

#### Limitations
Flexbox is not without it's downsides however. One of the biggest problems is that flexbox is not supported by all browsers. For a complete list of browser compatibility, check out this [link](http://caniuse.com/#search=flexbox).

#### To flexbox, or not to flexbox.
Sure, flexbox can make life easier in many different ways, but you need to be careful not to isolate your users. If a large chunk of your users are accessing your content on Internet Explorer 9, then it is probably not wise to use flexbox. I decided to use flexbox on the [distribution page](http://citypak.org/distributions) for [The Citypak Project](http://citypak.org).

What's nice about smaller projects like my personal site, is that the we have the ability to do whatever we want. I have used flexbox all over this site and love it. I will continue to use it when I am able to.
