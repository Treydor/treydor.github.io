While working on the [distribution page](http://citypak.org/distributions) for [The Citypak Project](http://citypak.org), I began to learn about a very powerful layout tool called flexbox. Flexbox can be extremely useful because it allows us to easily solve problems we face when trying to align items within a container.

### How it works
Start by adding the following code to your parent, or flex container. It's important that you use webkit prefixes for safari, or the entire flexbox element will be broken.

```css
.flex-container {
  display: -webkit-flex; /* Safari */
  display: flex;
}
```

That's it! We're now ready to apply properties to child elements. These are called flex items.

```css
.flex-item {
  -webkit-align-items: center; /* Safari */
  align-items:         center;
}
```

This particular example would allows us to vertically align items within a container.

There a wide variety of properties that can be applied to flex items. [A Visual Guide to CSS3 Flexbox Properties](https://scotch.io/tutorials/a-visual-guide-to-css3-flexbox-properties) talks about most of them and has a lot of visuals to demonstrate how the flex properties work.

### Limitations
Remember though, flexbox is not without it's downsides. One thing to think about when deciding whether or not to use flexbox is browser support. Unfortunately, flexbox is not supported by all browsers.

For a complete list of browser compatibility, check out this [link](http://caniuse.com/#search=flexbox).

Sure, flexbox can make life easier, but you need to be careful not to isolate your users. If a large chunk of your users are accessing your content on IE9, then it is probably not wise to use flexbox.

Given The Citypak Project's traffic, I decided that flexbox was an appropriate solution for the distribution list.

<div class="example">
  <div class="browser">
    <ul class="browser__toolbar">
      <li class="browser__button browser__button--red"></li>
      <li class="browser__button browser__button--yellow"></li>
      <li class="browser__button browser__button--green"></li>
    </ul>

  </div>
  <div class="example__description">The Citypak Project's <a href="http://www.citypak.org/distributions">distribution</a> page</div>
</div>

What's nice about smaller projects like my personal site, is that the we have the ability to do just about whatever we want. I have used flexbox all over this site and I really enjoy it. Flexbox still is not perfect, but is a great way to overcome obstacles when designer certain elements.

Thanks for reading!
