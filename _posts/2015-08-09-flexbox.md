While working on the [distribution page](http://citypak.org/distributions) for [The Citypak Project](http://citypak.org), I began to learn about and use a very powerful layout tool called flexbox.

Flexbox is great because it allows us to easily solve problems we face when trying to align items within a container.

#### Flexbox usage
Start by adding the following code to your parent, or flex container.

```css
.flex-container {
  display: -webkit-flex; /* Safari */
  display: flex;
}
```

That's it! We're now ready to apply properties to child elements, known as flex items.

```css
.flex-container {
  -webkit-align-items: center; /* Safari */
  align-items:         center;
}
```

Something like this would allow us to vertically align items within a container. There a wide variety of properties that can be applied to flex items. [A Visual Guide to CSS3 Flexbox Properties](https://scotch.io/tutorials/a-visual-guide-to-css3-flexbox-properties) talks about most of them and even has a lot of live examples to show you exactly how the flex properties work.

#### Limitations of Flexbox
Flexbox is not without it's downsides however. One of the biggest problems is that flexbox is not supported by all browsers. For a complete list of browser compatbility, check out this [link](http://caniuse.com/#search=flexbox).
