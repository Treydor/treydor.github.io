While working on the [distribution page](http://citypak.org/distributions) for [The Citypak Project](http://citypak.org), I began to learn about and use a very powerful layout tool called flexbox.

Flexbox is great because it allows us to easily solve problems we face when trying to align items within a container. The [A Visual Guide to CSS3 Flexbox Properties](https://scotch.io/tutorials/a-visual-guide-to-css3-flexbox-properties) over at scotch.io is a great overview on flexbox and how to use it.

Flexbox is not without it's downsides however. One of the biggest problems is that flexbox is not supported by all browsers. For a complete list of browser compatbility, check out this [link](http://caniuse.com/#search=flexbox).

In the near future I hope to create a project that really demonstrates the power of flexbox.
