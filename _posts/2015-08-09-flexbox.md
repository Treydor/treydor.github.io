While working on the [distribution page](http://citypak.org/distributions) for [The Citypak Project](http://citypak.org), I began to learn about a very powerful layout tool called flexbox. Flexbox can be extremely useful because it allows us to easily solve problems we face when trying to align items within a container.

#### How does it work?
Start by adding the following code to your parent, or flex container.

```
.flex-container {
  display: -webkit-flex; /* Safari */
  display: flex;
}
```

That's it! We're now ready to apply properties to child elements, known as flex items.

```
.flex-item {
  -webkit-align-items: center; /* Safari */
  align-items:         center;
}
```

This particular example would allows us to vertically align items within a container.

There a wide variety of properties that can be applied to flex items. [A Visual Guide to CSS3 Flexbox Properties](https://scotch.io/tutorials/a-visual-guide-to-css3-flexbox-properties) talks about most of them and has a lot of visuals to demonstrate how the flex properties work.

#### Limitations
Remember though, flexbox is not without it's downsides. One thing to think about when deciding whether or not to use flexbox is browser support. Unfortunately for us, flexbox is not supported by all browsers. For a complete list of browser compatibility, check out this [link](http://caniuse.com/#search=flexbox).

#### To flexbox, or not to flexbox.
Sure, flexbox can make life easier in many different ways, but you need to be careful not to isolate your users. If a large chunk of your users are accessing your content on Internet Explorer 9, then it is probably not wise to use flexbox.

Given the usage stats, I decided to use flexbox on the [distribution page](http://citypak.org/distributions) for [The Citypak Project](http://citypak.org).

What's nice about smaller projects like my personal site, is that the we have the ability to do just about whatever we want. I have used flexbox all over this site and love it. I will continue to use it when I am able to.

Thanks for reading!
