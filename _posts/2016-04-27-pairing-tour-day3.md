Wow, what a change of pace. Today I was able to pair with Mike Jansen and see the inner-workings of 8th Light's operations department. Having worked in similar roles before I joined 8th Light, I've had a certain appreciation for those who are responsible for getting things done behind the scenes. Today only further reinforced that sentiment.

Today was valuable for quite a few reasons. Mike was able to dive in to his process and talk about how he organizes and prioritizes the large amount of tasks he handles throughout the week. We also began to touch on various aspects of our hiring process. It was interesting to see the decision making and overall process from the inside. It wasn't too long ago that I actually went through the process myself.

I joined Mike for the daily operation team stand up, where everyone was able to talk about what they were working on for the day. We continued to take a look at our hiring process before we shifted gears and began to talk about the apprenticeship program.

I really had a blast learning more about 8th Light's operations. Working with Mike today brought me back to some my past experiences, particularly my time in the military where I held an operations role myself. I am looking forward to continuing my pairing tomorrow with Brian Pratt!
