One of the things that I really enjoy about web design is being able to build something from nothing. Although at times it may seem overwhelming gives us the luxury to do almost anything we want. I think a clear idea and a solid plan are essential to create a great final product.

#### Each project is not without it's challenges.

Although true, this can be a great opportunity to overcome to continue learning and refining what you already know. Whether be a small or large problem, using what I have learned thus far is important to overcoming these challenges. Throughout my learning process I have kept the most fundamental of practices in mind and constantly strive to keep my code as simple and clean as possible.

#### The cutting edge

Web development puts us on the forefront of the technology industry. Technology changes fast, and with the continuous introduction of new platforms, frameworks and languages, there is always something new and exciting to learn about. There is some really cool stuff that is possible, all we have to do is take the time to understand it.
