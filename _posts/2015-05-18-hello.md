I am an aspiring front-end developer who enjoys learning about simple and responsive web design.

One of the things that I really enjoy about web design is being able to build something great from nothing. Although it may seem overwhelming, the start of the design process is totally open and full of countless possibilities. This is why a clear idea and a solid plan are needed to achieve a great final product.

In addition to designing pages and elements that are visually appealing and read well, we also have the opportunity to overcome challenges and make our designs work as efficiently as possible. Throughout my learning process, and with the help my mentor, I have kept these practices in mind and find myself constantly striving to keep my code as simple and clean as possible.

Web development puts us on the cutting-edge of the technology industry. Technology changes fast, and with the ongoing introduction of new platforms, frameworks and languages, there is always something new and exciting to learn about. There is some really cool stuff that is possible, all we have to do is go out and learn it.

Why do you love web design as much as I do? <a href="https://twitter.com/treyd0r" target="_blank">Let me know</a> what you think.
