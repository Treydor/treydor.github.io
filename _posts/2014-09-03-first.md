Hello everyone!

This is a test post to familiarize myself with the Jekyll post system.

Jekyll posts use markdown, HTML or a combination of both. I have made a small one pager that highlights some key Jekyll commands. The cheat sheet can be found [here](/projects/Jekyll/index.html).

I will be sure to add a blog entry about various markdown commands in the near future. In the meantime I will be focusing on Positioning and Lengths projects.
