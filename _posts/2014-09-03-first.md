Hello! This is a test post to familiarize myself with the Jekyll post system. Jekyll posts can use markdown, html or a combination of both. I have maded a small cheat sheet so I can remember how to get Jekyll up and running. The cheat sheet can be found [here](/projects/Jekyll/index.html) I will be sure to add a blog entry about various markdown commands in the near future. Until then I will be trying to finish up my last blog entry, Positioning.
