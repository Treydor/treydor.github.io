On Monday I met with Eric Meyer and [Chris Peak](http://www.chrispeak.me) who introduced me to my new project. Eric wants to have all apprenticeship information centralized and in a place that's easily accessible and can be viewed at any time. My mentor Chris, thought this would be a great opportunity to create something new.

We still had many questions. Eric described the information he was interested in tracking, but suggested that this may have value outside of just him. The only way to find out was to actually talk to people and figure out their process when it came to apprenticeship data. Was this data even important to them? How were they using the data? Was the individual currently having any difficulties trying to apply the data? We wanted to get as much information as possible before we even thought about what we were going to create.

### Asking questions

Before I even began thinking about talking to people I wanted to make sure I knew exactly what information we were hoping to get from these interviews. My co-mentor, [Erica Garcia](http://www.ericagarcia.me) gave me some great advice. She cautioned me to think about how I was going to ask questions. She said that depending on how a question is asked, it may influence the interviewee's response. That advice was very valuable when beginning to thing about the questions I was going to ask.

### Ask the right questions

From past jobs and school I knew that asking questions that warranted a response other than yes or no was a great place to start. Keeping Erica's advice in mind, I created a small list of questions I could ask each individual.

* What is your position at 8th Light and how do you currently use apprenticeship data?
* How do you currently use apprenticeship data?
* How do you retrieve or access the data?
* Do you have any problems viewing the data?
* Would it be helpful if the data was centralized?

I thought answers to these questions would fuel the conversation and would ultimately add value when designing the app.

### Don't make any promises

The last thing we want to do during these interview is make any promises. Promises that we should avoid may come in the form of features to an existing app, or the development of a new app. It was important that during the interview process we made it clear that we were in a user research stage.

### Learning from our research

What we are learning is that each individual has their different needs when it comes to the data. What is very important to one person, may be hardly important to the next. We're still conducting interviews, but it is very interesting to hear all of the different use cases among everyone.

We still have a few more interviews to go, but I feel like the bones of the project are starting to take shape.
