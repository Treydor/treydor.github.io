Although I feel like I have finished up the greenfield blog series, I thought it would be a great idea to share a little bit more information about where Snapshot is and where it is going.

### Adding the magic
Recently, Eric finished up and deployed the backend of Snapshot so that it pulls data from another one of our internal apps, Warehouse. Warehouse holds employee data of all 8th Light employees, including apprentices.

When a new apprentice joins 8th Light a record in Warehouse is created. We populate their Warehouse record with dates regarding their apprenticeship, like review board dates and ultimate end date. This data is then pulled in by Snapshot and displayed within the styles I created. Pretty cool huh?

### Google's OAuth
The project uses OAuth so that you must have an 8th Light account to actually enter the app. Recently I added a sign in page to the app.

### Design changes
Let's talk about where the design is currently at. The overall design changed between the final mockup and implementation of the current design. Although the change may look very different, it was a small enough to where all of the other styles were still relevant.

The first thing you may notice is that I the overall width of each individual card is smaller. After weighing my options, I felt that smaller cards was this best direction to go. In the current design, I felt that three cards per row would ultimately save valuable screen real estate.

Secondly, you will probably also notice much of the MVP in the wireframes and mockups is not included. This is intentional, as backend functionality for many of the features has not been built in yet. We wanted to make sure that our app was in working condition at all times.

Lastly, the displayed data. The information that you see is currently being pulled from a local copy of warehouse, not a live version of the app. Some of the names are real and some are made up. In my local copy I actually created the records.

At this point, I feel everything is coming along nicely. This has been such a great project to work on. Working on this project has really taught me a lot about the entire design process. It's really cool to see something that was once just an idea start to take shape in to a real, usable app.

As much as fun as this project has been, I am already looking forward to my next project.
