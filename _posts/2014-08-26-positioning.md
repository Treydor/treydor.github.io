<p>So far we have been introduced to inline, inline-block and block elements. We have also explored floats, how to use them and when to use them. From our floats blog we have learned a little bit about positioning and how to make basic layouts or navigations using floats. Let's build off what we know. It has been a while for me so I think it would be best to first start with a small review about what we learned in our last blog post.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Floats are a positioning property.</li>
  <li>Floats allow elements to be moved left or right.</li>
  <li>When an element is floated, the element is removed from the normal flow of the HTML.</li>
  <li>When the float property is used, elements are shifted over until it touches the parent element, or another floated element.</li>
  <li>Floats are not perfect, and usually require the use of clearfixes to tell surrounding elements how to behave around the float.</li>
  <li>Floats are extremely useful, but may not be always be the best way of accomplishing desired effects.</li>
</ul>
