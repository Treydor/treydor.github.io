This week marks seven months as a resident apprentice at 8th Light. It's quite remarkable to think back to the first week of my apprenticeship...

My first week was plagued by uncertainty and a feeling of nervousness. Through this journey I feel like I have not only learned a great deal about software, but also more about the principles that makes 8th Light a special place to work.

My time as an apprentice has afforded me the opportunity to continue learning about design while also contributing to a number of different projects. Most recently, I have moved on to client work. This is one of the areas I was most excited to spend my time as an apprentice. Part of being a consultant at 8th Light is not only doing your job and doing it well, but also interfacing with our clients in such a way that is professional and knowledgable. I was ready for the challenge. I felt like my experience in the customer service sector would translate nicely to my role as a consultant even though this was my first position as a consultant and I was fairly new to the world of software.

As my apprenticeship rapidly approaches it's conclusion, I can't help but to be excited about my growth throughout this process. I look forward to continue to learn about design and eagerly await future challenges.

On a final note, last week I was told that my apprenticeship was ending a few months early. This is actually my last week as an apprentice. Next week I start my pairing tour, where I'll spend time pairing with a different Craftsman at 8th Light. The following week I'll be given my challenges where I'll have the opportunity to demonstrate what I have learned throughout my apprenticeship.
