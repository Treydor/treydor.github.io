Wow, what a whirlwind it's been. I have been extremely busy throwing myself in to a variety of books, projects, and even some client work. Although my time at 8th Light has been challenging, I wouldn't change any of it. I really enjoy coming to work and learning something new each day.

This last week I was fortunate to help at the Software Craftsmanship North America (SCNA) which was held near the USC campus in Los Angeles, California. It was my first conference and I thought it was really well done. It was great networking and learning more about our industry.

All of the speakers were great, but I think my favorite was the presentation by [Sarah Mei](https://twitter.com/sarahmei).

Sarah talked about software and the various models created to help facilitate software development. The main point of Sarah's presentation was rooted in the fact that the models we use today were created for the industrial and manufacturing industry. She instead offered up a third model that would better fit the software industry.

If you'd like, you can view Sarah's talk, as well as some others that took place during SCNA 2015. Check out the [SCNA website](http://scna2015.softwarecraftsmanship.com/) for the videos and information about SCNA 2016!

See you next year!
